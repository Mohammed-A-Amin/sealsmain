  <p class="paragraph"> I chose this image because it shows that I'm able to come up with ideas when I really put
      my mind to it. It sparks something in me. I used to work on graphic art for this game and it was really fun.
      They told me to think of a thumbnail idea and I got to work on it. The person who asked me seemed satisfied
      with what I'm able to come up with. That's why I have a lightbulb because I can be creative by thinking
      of good ideas.

<h2 class="Reflect1">Reflection: February 2nd, 2021</h2>
<p class="Reflectp">Today I learned many things about being a leader and improving myself as a person from learning from
    my mistakes. In order to explain things to people, you can't let them make assumptions about you, so you have
    to legitimize yourself through the power of storytelling. The most important lesson I learned today was about
    self-awareness aswell. It's about knowing what the consequences will be when doing something and think of
    outcomes and visions. That's why I'm going to manage my time more efficiently than the last time we  
    met so I'm able to complete the assignments on time and be above on beyond. I shouldn't make excuses any more
    and be more honest and open about what I'm doing and recognize it. This week, I hope to better know my classmates
    aswell as be consistent with all my work.

  <h2 class="Reflect1">Reflection: February 4th, 2021</h2>
  <p class="Reflectp">Today I learned that I really need to start managing my time. There is a lot of work being thrown from SEALS and from 
    school too, so I should start setting a schedule for myself so I can get everything done efficiently on time. I also learned that I need to
    start engaging more in group discussions and think of a way to add value to them. I can't just sit there and watch the conversation go as Oscar
    had mentioned. It does seem really overwhelming right now, but I believe that I can make it through this program, just 7 more weeks to go 
     to go and I want me and all my brothers to succeed through the finish line, we just need to work together better.
